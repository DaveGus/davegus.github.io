   <h2>Spending Time with my Family</h2>
   <p>Time with my family is something I don't take for granted. I look forward to seeing them anytime I've been gone for a few hours but some days it only takes a few minutes; a few minutes at home until I miss being away that is. ;-)</p>

   <div class="itemsrow"> 
   <h2>Whiteater Kayaking</h2>
    <p>My Mom tells me that the first time I ever sat up by myself it was next to the Kettle River while my Dad was kayaking it. Even after traveling to 35+ different countries the Kettle River at Banning State Park remains one of my favorite places in the world</p>
    <p>Whitewater kayaking is such a passion for me that I'm getting a little dopamine (or is that adrenaline? Oh well, same thing as far as I'm concerned) rush just writing this. It sounds crazy and it can be but generally speaking, driving to the river is more dangerous than paddling it.</p> 
    <p>Having said that, take a look at the video below. This isn't the Kettle River nor is it something for a beginner. It <em>is</em> however, an example of what you need to be ready for. Not necessarily this exactly, but experiencing situations that feel as out of control and hopeless as this probably looks. The good news is that this went almost exactly as expected. It just wasn't exactly what was hoped for.</p>

   <div class="itemsrow"> 
   <h2>Doing Standup Comedy</h2>
   <p>I know I said I actively try to avoid finding new things that I will enjoy but this one snuck up on me. I'm obviously an adrenaline junkie because I'm amazed by how amazed people are that I would get on stage like that. Aparently they don't realize how arrogant I am or they'd encourage me to do it hoping I'll be brought down a peg or two. However, the first time I did it I "killed" as they say and although the drive to get to the "river" is a lot shorter for standup, sitting through our routines is scarier and more painful than most rivers I've paddled...and sometimes you worry about getting an infection from ingesting some really bad stuff but it's worth it when it goes well.</p>
